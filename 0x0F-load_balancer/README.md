# Load Balancer README.

### Mandatory Tasks.

***0. Double the number of webservers***

	* Configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Since weâ€™re placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works.

	* Requirements:

		- Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
			* The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
			* The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
		- Write 0-custom_http_response_header so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine.
			* Ignore SC2154 for shellcheck

***1. Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.***

	* Requirements:

		- Configure HAproxy so that it send traffic to web-01 and web-02
		- Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm
		- Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script
		- Servers should be configured with the right hostnames: [STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02.

	- Write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
